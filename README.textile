h1. Sinatra-REST

Actually it's a set of templates to introduce RESTful routes in Sinatra. The 
only thing for you to do is to provide the views. The routes and some 
url helpers will be provided behind the scenes.


h2. Installation

Guess what!

  sudo gem source --add http://gems.github.com
  sudo gem install blindgaenger-sinatra-rest


h2. Usage

Of course you need to require the gem in your sinatra application:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'sinatra'
  require 'rest'

It's very similar to defining routes in Sinatra (@get@, @post@, ...). But this 
time you don't define the routes by yourself, but use the model's name for 
convention.

For example, if the model's class is called @Person@ you only need to add this 
line:

  rest Person
  
Which will add the following RESTful routes to your application. (Note the 
pluralization of @Person@ to the @/people/*@ routes.)

* GET    /people
* GET    /people/new
* POST   /people
* GET    /people/1
* GET    /people/1/edit
* PUT    /people/1
* DELETE /people/1

That's it!
